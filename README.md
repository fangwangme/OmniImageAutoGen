6. Click the extension icon and select **Open Side Panel**

### Option 2: Build from Source

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/fangwangme/GeminiAutoGen.git
cd GeminiAutoGen
```

2. Install dependencies and build:

```bash

## ⚙️ Setup

Before using the extension, you need to configure the file directories:

1. Click the **⚙️ Settings** button in the side panel

2. **Source Folder** - The folder where Chrome automatically downloads files (e.g., `Downloads` or `Downloads/Chrome`)

   - This is where Gemini saves images when you click "Download full size"

3. **Output Folder** - The final destination folder for renamed images (e.g., `Downloads/GeminiOutput`)
   - Images will be automatically renamed and moved here

4. **Language** - Choose the UI language (English/中文)

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Prompts

Create a JSON file with an array of tasks:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "sunset_beach.png",
    "prompt": "A beautiful sunset over a tropical beach with palm trees"
  },
  {
    "name": "mountain_lake.png",
    "prompt": "A serene mountain lake reflecting snow-capped peaks"
  }
]
```

### 2. Lock Conversation (Optional but Recommended)

To use the same Gemini conversation for all images:

1. Open [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) and create or open a chat
2. Copy the URL from the address bar
3. Paste it in the **Locked Conversation URL** input
4. Click **Lock**

This ensures all images are generated in the same context, even if you restart the browser.

### 3. Start Generation

1. Load your JSON file using the file picker
2. Click **Start**
3. Watch the progress as images are generated and saved

The extension will:

- Send each prompt to Gemini
- Wait for image generation (timeout is configurable in Settings; default 120s)
- Click "Download full size"
- Rename and move the file to your output folder
- Recreate the browser tab between tasks for reliability

## 📚 Technical Docs

To keep this README focused on usage, implementation details are documented in `docs/`:

- `docs/README.md` - technical docs index (best entry point)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - architecture overview

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Please open gemini.google.com"

- Make sure you're on a Gemini chat page, or lock a conversation URL first

### Downloads fail silently

- This is usually caused by browser context corruption
- The extension automatically recreates tabs between tasks to prevent this

### "No file loaded"

- Your JSON file may be invalid
- Ensure it's an array of objects with `name` and `prompt` properties

### Extension stops unexpectedly

- Click **Reset** to clear all state
- Reload the extension from `chrome://extensions/`
- Start again with your JSON file
